# This is a single Page portfolio project idea

👋 About Me

Hey there! I'm Ajay, a passionate frontend developer who loves crafting beautiful, interactive web experiences. With a keen eye for design and a love for animations, I build smooth, dynamic, and engaging UIs using React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

I believe that the web should be fast, fun, and accessible—so I make sure my projects reflect that philosophy. When I'm not coding, you’ll find me exploring design trends, tweaking animations, or scrolling through dev Twitter!

🚀 Projects

Here are some cool things I've built:

    🎨 Creative Portfolio – A visually stunning, animated portfolio built with React + Framer Motion.
    🛒 Chota-Jobs – A fully responsive Job Search UI with smooth page transitions.
